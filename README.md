Graceful degradation and service workers are related concepts in web development because they make sure that the website is able to run under less than ideal circumstances. Graceful degradation is when a web application is able to maintain basic functionality even when some advanced features are not supported or fail. It ensures that users on older browsers or with limited capabilities can still access essential content and services. Service workers are scripts that run in the background of a web application, providing features like offline support. It intercepts network requests and serves cached content. Service workers are useful to graceful degradation by enabling web applications to function smoothly even when the network is unreliable or unavailable.
